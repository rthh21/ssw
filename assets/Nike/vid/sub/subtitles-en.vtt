00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,190
- [Derek] The Air Max 1000 design process

00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,660
is a supercharged version

00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:05,498
of the typical product creation process.

00:00:05,498 --> 00:00:08,248
(exciting music)

00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,950
- Hi, my name's Jake Scannapieco.

00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:13,620
I'm the lead 3D designer
for the Air Max 1000.

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,180
- My name is Cristian Gonzalez.

00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,100
I'm a lead footwear designer at Nike.

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,712
- My name is Derek Houng,
developer and engineer at Nike.

00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:24,090
(exciting music continues)

00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,200
Innovation is about testing

00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,140
and creating new ideas for the audience.

00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,910
It starts with an idea or concept

00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,800
and morphs into a beautiful design

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,886
that leads the Air Max fans someplace new.

00:00:33,886 --> 00:00:38,010
(exciting music continues)

00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,960
The Air Bag and the Mudguard Wave

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,120
are two features that
we wanted to focus on,

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,386
as they make the Air Max 1 so memorable.

00:00:44,386 --> 00:00:48,780
(exciting music continues)

00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,054
Without a doubt, it's the
unlimited potential of Nike Air

00:00:51,054 --> 00:00:53,880
and the DNA of Air Max
which powers the midsole

00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,137
and design lines of this shoe.

00:00:55,137 --> 00:00:57,450
The combination of air and 3D

00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:59,316
creates a very engaging
underfoot experience

00:00:59,316 --> 00:01:02,184
that delivers insane
comfort and responsiveness.

00:01:02,184 --> 00:01:06,570
(exciting music continues)

00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,520
- 3D printing is an additive
manufacturing process

00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,637
that creates a physical
object from a digital design.

00:01:11,637 --> 00:01:14,051
The process works by
layering a raw material

00:01:14,051 --> 00:01:16,406
and fusing it together
to create an object.

00:01:16,406 --> 00:01:19,989
(exciting music continues)

00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,447
3D printing enhances our ideas

00:01:22,447 --> 00:01:26,190
by allowing us to create
something like the Air Max 1000,

00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,660
which was previously impossible

00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,760
through traditional
manufacturing processes.

00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,190
Our process ideas and expertise paired

00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:34,380
with 3D design played a massive role

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,849
in bringing the clearest representation

00:01:35,849 --> 00:01:37,380
of our ideas to life.

00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,909
This process enabled us
to think of the AM 1000

00:01:39,909 --> 00:01:41,970
as a wearable sculpture.

00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,730
- The experience on foot
is really hard to describe.

00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,670
It's almost like opposite
sensations matched into one,

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,520
like soft and responsive
and plush and supportive.

00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,900
You really just gotta try it on.

00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,650
I'm Derek Houng, and this
has been "Behind the Design."
